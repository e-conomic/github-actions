# github-actions
Repository for shared GitHub Actions

This repository contains reusable github action jobs that can be used in the GitHub action workflows in other repositories.

## How to use
In order to use the actions from this repo, it needs to be cloned, since this is a private repo and GitHub does not have access to it.
```yaml
- name: Checkout shared actions
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    repository: 'e-conomic/github-actions'
    ref: 'v2'
    ssh-key: ${{ secrets.SHARED_GITHUB_ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
    path: '_github-actions'
```
No need to change anything in this declaration, but to just in case you're wondering:
* `ref` -  is a release versino of the repo you want to use. You should always use the [latest version](https://github.com/e-conomic/github-actions/releases)
* `path` - is the location of the local folder on the runner, where the repo will be cloned
* `ssh-key` - is a deploy key that is already available in the organization secrets


## Actions
* docker-build-push
* polaris-sast
* upload-docs

The following examples assume that you have included a github-actions repo checkout in the previous step.

### docker-build-push
Build docker image and publish

```yaml
- name: Docker build and push
  uses: ./_github-actions/docker-build-push
  with:
    password: ${{ secrets.DEVECONOCM_GCR_RW }}
    tags: eu.gcr.io/dev-econo-cm/<project-name-and-version>
```
#### User customizable options
`tags` - replace **<project-name-and-version>** with you own value.
ex.: `companies:${{ github.ref_name }}-${{ env.SHA7 }}`
  
  By default github context does not provide short SHA of the commit. There are multiple ways to calculate short SHA and this is just one example. You can add an additional step before calling `docker-build-push` to generate a string formatted SHA containing 7 characters:
```yaml
- name: Get commit short SHA
  run: echo SHA7=${GITHUB_SHA::7} >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### polaris-sast
Run polaris static application security testing. The action runs on the root folder of the cloned application repository.
```yaml
- name: Static application security testing
  uses: ./_github-actions/polaris-sast
  with:
    api_url: ${{ secrets.POLARIS_API_URL }}
    access_token: ${{ secrets.POLARIS_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
#### User customizable options
None
 
### upload-docs
Upload documentation to docs.e-conomic.ws
```yaml
- name: Upload docs
  uses: ./_github-actions/upload-docs
  with:
    docs_bucket_sa: ${{ secrets.DOCS_BUCKET_SA }}
```
#### User customizable options
None
